mention standardized templates for fish passage assessment and the ones that we use for fisheries information.

Gitxsan Watershed Authorities report that Xsan Xsagiibil was a 
fishing site located at the mouth of Station Creek (Xsi Gwin Sagiiblax). 

SKR (2006) conducted a detailed inspection, offered rehabilitation design 
options and identified the natural limits of potential fish distribution to support 
rehabilitation efforts.

here is a good example of a dead ringer barrier on a 12m wide system that 
should be connected to the Bulkley River

Here is Byman Creek also in the Bulkley River watershed. Not so straight forward.
Streamkeepers report fry moving through observed in overwintering studies but is
the depth an issue for adult Chinook. We hope to look into it!

here is one right in the middle. Richfield Creek. 13m wide channel, amazing habitat.  An issue? 
One issue is that it would cost millions to replace. How do we find out how much of an issue it is to fish?

Working on connectivity between data sets as well as between partners and stakeholders and rode owners and non-profits and first nations and railway companies and pipeline companies and forestry companies.
And listening to everyone because our connections to what we think matter maybe matters the most.
My passion is linking together datasets to tell stories. When we tell stories we can preserve truth and we can explore truth rediscover our cultures while reinventing new ones.
